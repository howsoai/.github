# About

The [Howso Engineâ„¢](https://howso.com/engine) is a natively and fully explainable ML engine, serving as an alternative to black box AI neural networks. Its core functionality gives users data exploration and machine learning capabilities through the creation and use of Trainees that help users store, explore, and analyze the relationships in their data, as well as make understandable, debuggable predictions. Howso leverages an instance-based learning approach with strong ties to the [k-nearest neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) algorithm and [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory) to scale for real world applications.

# Getting Started

## Install Howso Engine

We recommend most developers and data sciencists use Howso's Python wrapper to get started:  
[Engine Repository (Python)](https://github.com/howsoai/howso-engine-py)
> Installation instructions can be found in the README.md file of the Engine repository.

## Run Recipes

Recipes illustrate important concepts and show how these tools can be used. Start with our classic collection using Jupiter notebooks:  
[Howso Engine Recipes Repository](https://github.com/howsoai/howso-engine-recipes)

For those interested in reinforcement learning, check out:  
[Howso Reinforcement Learning Recipes](https://github.com/howsoai/howso-engine-rl-recipes)

## Documentation and Visualization

Howso's current documentation can be found at:  
[docs.howso.com](https://docs.howso.com)  

To draft new documentation related to your project use:
[Howso Documentation Repository](https://github.com/howsoai/howso-docs). This runs documentation locally using Docker.  

For visualizing and plotting data using python checkout:  
[Howso Visualization Library](https://github.com/howsoai/howso-visuals-py)

# Dive Deeper

## Amalgam&trade;

Amalgam is the domain specific language used in Howso Engine. Use Amalgam to define functions and enable instance-based learning.

Coding in Amalgam can be done natively or through the [Amalgam Python wrapper](https://github.com/howsoai/amalgam-lang-py). The Python wrapper handles the binaries for the user so the user just needs to worry about the code.

The native Amalgam Howso Engine is also available:  
[Engine Repository (Amalgam)](https://github.com/howsoai/howso-engine) 

### Tools for Amalgam

* [Amalgam VS Code IDE Support](https://github.com/howsoai/amalgam-ide-support-vscode) (Recommended) 
The Amalgam VSCode extension provides support for syntax highlighting and debugging for the Amalgam language.

* [Amalgam Build Container - Linux](https://github.com/howsoai/howso-engine-no-telemetry)  
Linux container for building the Amalgam language interpreter.

* [Amalgam Notepad++ IDE Support](https://github.com/howsoai/amalgam-ide-support-npp)  
This project contains a single XML file that can be used to add syntax highlighting for Amalgam code in Notepad++.

# Additional Repos

[Howso Local No-Telemetry Overlay](https://github.com/howsoai/howso-engine-no-telemetry)  
This project serves simply to overlay add an "extra" configuration to ensure telemetry is switched off. The goal is to keep this as thin as possible so that no additional effort is required on a per-release basis of Howso Engine.
